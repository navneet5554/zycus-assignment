We will follow below steps for migration the mentioned java application stack and i am considering a AWS environment.

Step-1 :- We will create instances according to attached diagram, where we have used HA setup( ELB with two web servers at backend and MongoDB (master-slave setup).
Note : We can also create MongoDB server in Mongo Cloud.
 
Step-2 :- Install all packages which we have in the previous instance from where we are planning for migration, e.g Apache, tomcat, ActiveMQ, Oracle). All packages should be the same version.

Step-3 :- Setup an ELB server with define backend web servers over it.

Step-4 :- We will sync all data into new webservers using rsync tool with define limited bandwidth and also define priority using NICE command.

Step-5 :- There be two-way for migrating database

(a) If a database is not large then we will take a dump and restore over the new instance.
(b) Otherwise, we will we take a downtime and stop the database and sync it.

Steps-6 : We need to setup a connection between web server and database.
